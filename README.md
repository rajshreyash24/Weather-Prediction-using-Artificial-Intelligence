# Weather-Prediction-using-Artificial-Intelligence
The Weather Prediction using Artificial Intelligence project employs machine learning to improve weather forecasting accuracy. By analyzing historical data and real-time observations, the project develops an intelligent system for precise and timely weather predictions.

The best thing is,  you can get started using Neural Prophet. Neural Prophet is a relatively new library that uses Facebook's Prophet time series forecasting package and a Pytorch AR-Net model to quickly produce highly accurate time series forecasts. This makes it easy to forecast with any other time series-style data.

### Steps Used:
1. Preprocess a weather dataset from Kaggle using Pandas.
2. Train a time series forecasting model to predict temperature using Neural Prophet.
3. Forecast temperature into the future using the trained model.
